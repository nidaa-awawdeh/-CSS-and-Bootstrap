#### Part I
Answer the following questions <br>

1-What is an em? <br>
**It means emphemeral unit  Relative to the font-size of the element**<br>
2-What is the difference between em and rem? <br>
**Relative to font-size of the root element**
<p>em - 1em is equal to the default font-size for the element. This lets you set properties involving length relative to this font size. Note that if you define the font-size in terms of ems, 1em will correspond to the font-size of the parent.
rem - just like em's but they are only relative to the root (i.e. html) element. This means that 1rem corresponds to the same size everywhere on the page <p> <br>

3-What is "mobile first" design? <br>
**A mobile-first approach forces you to think about mobile users before you think of desktop users.** <br>

4-What is BEM? <br>
